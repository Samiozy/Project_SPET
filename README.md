# Project_SPET
A Python-based ArcGIS tool to automate Solar Power Potential Mapping
The SPET toolbox includes two tools, “Solar Radiation Estimation” and “Suitable Building Calculation,” created by modifying the Toolbox template provided by ArcGIS Pro. The first tool, SPET, is designed to estimate the amount of rooftop solar radiation that can be obtained from buildings. This is achieved by applying appropriate suitability criteria for slope, aspect, and minimum radiation value. By providing inputs such as building footprint and digital elevation model (DEM) data, the tool can calculate the amount of solar radiation that the building rooftop would receive. The output of this tool is a feature layer with a field populated with the estimated solar radiation values for each building footprint. The second tool, Suitable Building Calculation, is designed to calculate the amount of power that can be generated by a building based on its rooftop solar radiation. This tool takes the output from the SPET tool as input and calculates the power generated by the building in kilowatt-hours per year.
